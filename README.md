# Joseph_Mullins_PCA
Grapevine PCA project for CMSE410 at MSU, in collaboration with Dr. Dan Chitwood.
This project seeks to perform Principal Component Analysis on a set of grapevine leaves, then perform an inverse transform function in order to generate the shapes of hypothetical leaves.  Further, leaves can be plotted, and overplotted, along a computed 'line of development' in order to track the shape of a grapevine leaf through it's development.
